Example JUnit integration with Spring MVC

It's been a while so this is a good refresher - a lot has changed in recent versions of Spring.

# Sample Endpoint 

```
    http://localhost:8080/junitspringtest/test/fetch
```

Run the unit and integration tests locally using an IDE of your choice. I'd recommend Jetbrains!

# Integration Tests

Specify that the combined or aggregate functionality of a context is working as it should.

Now, test contexts can be passed in through annotated contexts.

# Unit Tests

Specify that a specific code block or piece of functionality is working as it should.

This will be handled using simple Mocked objects rather than using annotations.
