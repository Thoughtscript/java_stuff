# JavaEEServlet

Simple example demonstrating three ways to display JSP in Java EE.  No Spring, just Java EE.

## What's Here?

Three different ways to serve JSP in Java EE:
```
Via PrintWriter and HttpServlet
Via static HTML
Using annotation-driven servlet registration and forwarding
```

## Helpful?

I wrote a related article for Baeldung, an open-source Java instruction site, that goes into greater detail about servlets - see it here:
