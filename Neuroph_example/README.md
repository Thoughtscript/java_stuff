Programmatic Neuroph Example!

## What Is It?

This is a very simple example that will be used in a future article to help teach basic concepts of machine learning/artifical neural nets (both topics undergird artificial intelligence and deep learning) and how to use Neuroph!

## Basic Layout

Built up through Layers - makes explicit some of the abstracted functions (invoking the constructor of a NeuralNetwork subclass allows one to simply specify the number of neurons for each of many sequential layers - that method involves assigning layers, neurons, setting connections between them, etc.).

## Core Concepts

A *neuron* has *connections*, *input functions*, and *weights* which link it to other *neurons*

A *layer* is made of *neurons*

A *neural network* is made of *layers*

*Neural networks* are the trained with *data sets* and *learning rules*

## Versioning and Use

It's MIT licensed but if there's no star and/or no release then it's not ready!
